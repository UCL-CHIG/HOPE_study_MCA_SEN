## Project and repository description
We cleaned and appended publicly available school information, which was held by the London School of Economics (LSE), Bristol University, the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) and downloaded from the Department for Education (DfE) website. Schools have merged, closed and combined over time leading to changes to governance and school identifiers. We created a lookup file to match the same school over time via Unique Reference Numbers (URNs). This dateset currently runs from 1996 to 2019, but could be updated to 2023 as of June 2023.
