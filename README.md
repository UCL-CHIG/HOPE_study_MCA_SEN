## School-recorded special educational needs provision in children with major congenital anomalies: a linked administrative records study of births in England, 2003-2013
### Aim of this study
Using a national cohort of births in England between 2003 and 2013, we aimed to describe patterns of survival to the start of compulsory education and frequencies of recorded SEN provision across children with and without a broad range of major congenital anomalies identified in hospital and mortality records. Specifically, we estimated: rates of survival up to the age 5 years; the prevalence of recorded SEN provision (of those attending a state-funded school); and differences in the prevalence of recorded SEN provision between children attending state-funded school before and after the 2014 SEN reforms.
